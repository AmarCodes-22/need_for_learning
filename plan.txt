This is going to be a 6 week long project.
The purpose is to learn as much as possible and find new ways to apply the learned stuff to the game.
Introduction:
    We are going to try to make an AI win the blacklist races.
    The AI will learn to drive the car from start to end of a race.
    I will also be doing some side projects, that could be a building block to the whole project,
    or may not have anything to do with it :)

The project is going to have 2 stages.
1. Object detection
    This stage deals with the computer vision part of the project.
    Some side projects also use computer vision to get familiar with other domains.
2. Reinforcement learning
    After object detection works great, we need to use it to be able to drive the car.
    The self_driving_2d was a big fail in this stage 
    which showcases the complexity of making a rule based self driving car.
    I will use reinforcement learning to figure out navigation.

Main project TO-DO: (Always contains the next 5 things that i am going to do)
    > Read road lane detection research paper
    > Data collection for data dump
    > Capturing and displaying screen with high fps
    > Reinforcement learning course
    > Use yolo for a smaller problem to get familiar with it

Tech-stack:
Streamlit, Flask, Tensorflow, OpenCV, ...

Side projects:
(These projects are sorted in increasing level of difficulty and decreasing level of familiarity)

> Web scraping some data from the nfs fandom wiki
    url: https://nfs.fandom.com/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Most_Wanted

> Image Classification/Recognition(Try out a bunch of models)
    > Make a classification CNN that can classify between the stock cars present in the shop.
    > Make a classification CNN that can classify between the blacklist.

> Object Character Recognition
    > Read the text off the speedometers to get the speed of the car and stuff.

> Segmentation
    > Apply segmentation to the ingame footage/scenery.

> Style transfer (Available as a REST API)
    > Apply real world lighting to the stock cars present in the shop.
    > Apply game environment to real world cars.

Maybe(Some side projects that i may do...)
    > Scene reconstruction
    > NLP applied to the soundtrack, or some other audio based project 
    > Motion estimation(maybe apply this on the trailer of the game)
