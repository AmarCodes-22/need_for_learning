# Lanes detection
Overview:
In this project we try to find lanes in Need for speed Most Wanted 2005.
Even though the project focuses primarily on the game, the concepts used are inspired by real world lane detection procedures.
The complete project consists of multiple subtasks each of which is a stepping stone to the final output where the lanes are detected.
Subtask 1: Game screen capture
Subtask 2: Color space filtering
Subtask 3: Lanes detection
